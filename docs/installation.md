# Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
‚úèÔ∏è If you want to improve this document, make a Pull Request to the [docker-compose](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-docker-compose) repository and edit the [relevant file](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-docker-compose/blob/master/docs/installation.md).
{% endhint %}

We are using `docker` and `docker-compose` to provide as consistent a local development environment as possible, in accordance with [12factor](https://12factor.net/) development principles.

## System Requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
üíª This repository has been tested and is working well on Linux and OSX. It should work on Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), but not thoroughly tested.
{% endhint %}

Firstly, check you have all the requirements on your system.\
For Linux users, these are either preinstalled or available through your distribution's package manager.

- [git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - Instructions for installing make vary, for OSX users `xcode-select --install` might work
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) - This should be installed along with docker on OSX and Windows
- [envsubst](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23620827/envsubst-command-not-found-on-mac-os-x-10-8/23622446#23622446) - This should be pre-installed on most Linux distributions
- [unzip](https://linuxhint.com/unzip_command_-linux/)

## First run

The first time you'll need to follow the steps below, in order to clone this repo and build the containers.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-docker-compose

# Navigate to new directory
cd planet4-docker-compose

# Build containers, start and configure the application
make dev
```

If you want the application repositories to be cloned using ssh protocol, instead of https, you can use a variable:

```bash
GIT_PROTO="ssh" make dev
```

If you want to run docker-compose commands directly:

```bash
# Set your shell environment variables correctly
eval $(make env)

# View status of containers
docker-compose ps

# View log output
docker-compose logs -f
```

On first launch, the container bootstraps the installation with composer then after a few minutes all services will be ready and responding to requests.

When the terminal is finished, and you see the line 'ready', navigate to [www.planet4.test](http://www.planet4.test).

It's not necessary to re-run `make dev` each time you wish to start the local development environment. To start containers on subsequent runs, use:

```bash
make run
```

### Full environment

In order to keep the environment light, the default setup skips some containers that are useful for debugging and testing.
Namely: PhpMyAdmin, ElasticHQ and Selenium. If you need them, you can use the full environment config by setting an environment variable:

```bash
DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.full.yml" make run
```

## Troubleshooting

To view the output of running containers:

```bash
eval $(make env)
docker-compose logs
```

If at any point the install process fails, with Composer showing a message such as `file could not be downloaded (HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found)`, this is a transient network error and re-running the install should fix the issue.

## Stop

To stop all the containers just run:

```bash
make stop
```

## Updating

To update all containers, run:

```bash
make run
```

## Editing source code

By default, the Wordpress application is bind-mounted at:

`./persistence/app/`

All planet4 code will be under the Wordpress' content folder:

`./persistence/app/public/wp-content/`

## Logging in

### Administrator login

Backend administrator login is available at [www.planet4.test/wp-admin/](http://www.planet4.test/wp-admin/).

Login username is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

### Database access via phpMyAdmin

[phpmyadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/) login: [pma.www.planet4.test](http://pma.www.planet4.test)

### Elasticsearch access via ElasticHQ
